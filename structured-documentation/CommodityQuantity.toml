Specifies the commodity and quantity a value is describing.

This enumeration is used to specify the commodity and quantity of an accompanying value. It's used in many places where S2 information is shared in a commodity-agnostic way; for example, in `PEBC.EnergyConstraint` it's used to specify what commodity/quantity the constraint is about.
